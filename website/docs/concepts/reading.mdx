Before reading this guide, make sure to [read about Providers](/docs/concepts/providers) first.

In this guide, we will see how to consume a provider.

There are multiple ways to read a provider, which change slightly based on different
criterias.  
Long story short, here is a decision graph to help you decide what to use to
read a provider:

![Decision graph for reading providers](/img/intro/reading.svg)

Next, we will see each individual case and show how they work.  
For this guide, consider the following provider:

```dart
final counterProvider = StateProvider((ref) => 0);
```

## Deciding what to read

Depending on the provider you want to listen, you may have multiple possible
values that you can listen.

An example, consider the following [StreamProvider]:

```dart
final userProvider = StreamProvider<User>(...);
```

When reading this `userProvider`, you can:

- synchronously read the current state by listening to `userProvider` itself:

  ```dart
  Widget build(BuildContext context, ScopedReader watch) {
    AsyncValue<User> user = watch(userProvider);

    return user.when(
      loading: () => const CircularProgressIndicator(),
      error: (error, stack) => const Text('Oops'),
      data: (user) => Text(user.name),
    );
  }
  ```

- obtain the associated [Stream], by listening to `userProvider.stream`:

  ```dart
  Widget build(BuildContext context, ScopedReader watch) {
    Stream<User> user = watch(userProvider.stream);
  }
  ```

- obtain a [Future] that resolves with the latest value emitted, by listening to `userProvider.last`:

  ```dart
  Widget build(BuildContext context, ScopedReader watch) {
    Future<User> user = watch(userProvider.last);
  }
  ```

For more information, refer to the documentation of each individual provider by
consulting the [API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/riverpod/latest/riverpod/riverpod-library.html).

## Consuming a provider inside widgets

In this section, we will see how Flutter widgets can interact with providers.

### ConsumerWidget

[ConsumerWidget] is a base-class for Widgets similar to `StatelessWidget`, but
that allows you to listen to providers.

```dart {5}
class Home extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, ScopedReader watch) {
    // Listens to the value exposed by counterProvider
    int count = watch(counterProvider).state;

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Counter example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('$count'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Notice how the value of `counterProvider` is obtained by a function called `watch`.  
This function is what makes [ConsumerWidget] listen to our provider and rebuild
when the value exposed changed.

:::caution
The `watch` method passed as an argument of [ConsumerWidget] should not be called
asynchronously, like inside `onPressed` or a [RaisedButton].

If you need to read a provider in response to a user event, see [myProvider.read(BuildContext)](#myproviderreadbuildcontext)
:::

### Consumer

[Consumer] is a [ConsumerWidget] that you can use to optimize the performances
of your application by rebuilding only the widgets that needs use the data.

For example, we could update the code snippet from [ConsumerWidget](#ConsumerWidget)
we saw previously to rebuild **only** the `Text` when the counter changes:

```dart {11}
class Home extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Counter example')),
      body: Center(
        child: Consumer(
          // Rebuild only the Text when counterProvider updates
          builder: (context, watch, child) {
            // Listens to the value exposed by counterProvider
            int count = watch(counterProvider).state;
            return Text('$count');
          },
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This example will make our UI listen to `counterProvider` and rebuild a [Text]
(and only that [Text]) when the counter changes.

### useProvider (hooks_riverpod only)

If you are using [flutter_hooks]/[hooks_riverpod], an alternative to [ConsumerWidget]
is to use [useProvider].

```dart
class Count extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    int count = useProvider(counterProvider).state;
    return Text('$count');
  }
}
```

This can be useful when you want to use both [flutter_hooks] and [Riverpod] together.  
This syntax also supports a feature that are not supported by [ConsumerWidget]: [select]

```dart
class Example extends HookWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    bool isAbove5 = useProvider(counterProvider.select((s) => s.state > 5));
    return Text('Is counter > 5 ? $isAbove5');
  }
}
```

Using this syntax, our widget will rebuild _only_ if the `isAbove5` variable changes.
Which means that if the counter changes from `1` to `2`, this will _not_
cause our widget to rebuild.

### context.read(myProvider)

With [Consumer] and [useProvider], we've seen how to _listen_ to a provider.

But in some situations, there's no value in listening to the object. For example,
we may need the object only for the `onPressed` of a [RaisedButton].

We _could_ use [useProvider]/[Consumer]:

```dart {2,4}
Consumer(builder: (context, watch, _) {
  StateController<int> counter = watch(counterProvider);
  return RaisedButton(
    onPressed: () => counter.state++,
    child: Text('increment'),
  )
});
```

But that is not efficient. Depending on the provider listened, this
could cause the [RaisedButton] to rebuild when the counter changes,
even when the counter isn't actually used to _build_ the [RaisedButton].

That's where `context.read(myProvider)` is a solution.

Using it, we could refactor our previous code to:

```dart {4}
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return RaisedButton(
    onPressed: () => context.read(counterProvider).state++,
    child: Text('increment'),
  );
}
```

By doing so, clicking on our button still increments the counter. But we
are no-longer listening to the provider, which avoids unnecessary rebuilds.

> I don't see the `context.read` method, why is that?

If you do not see `context.read`, it is likely that you did not import the correct
package.
To see this method, you must import either `package:flutter_riverpod` or `package:hooks_riverpod`.

:::info
Depending on the provider that you are listening to, you may not need to do this.  
For example, [StateNotifierProvider] has a built-in way obtain a [StateNotifier]
without listening to its state:

```dart
class Counter extends StateNotifier<int> {
  Counter(): super(0);

  void increment() => state++;
}

final counterProvider = StateNotifierProvider((ref) => Counter());

// ...

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context, ScopedReader watch) {
  // Obtains Counter without listening to Counter.state.
  // Will not cause the button to rebuild when the counter changes.
  final Counter counter = watch(counterProvider);

  return RaisedButton(
    onPressed: counter.increment,
    child: Text('increment'),
  );
}
```

:::

:::caution
Avoid calling `context.read` inside the `build` method of a Widget.  
If you want to optimize rebuilds, extract the value listened in a [Provider] instead.
:::

### ProviderListener

In some situations, you may want to your Widget tree to push a route or show
a dialog after a change on a provider.

Such behavior would be implemented using the [ProviderListener] Widget.

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ProviderListener<StateController<int>>(
    provider: counterProvider,
    onChange: (context, counter) {
      if (counter.state == 5) {
        showDialog(...);
      }
    },
    child: Whatever(),
  );
}
```

This will show a dialog when the counter reaches 5.

## Reading a provider inside another provider

A common use-case when making providers is to want to create an object from other
objects.  
For example, we may want to create a `UserController` from a `UserRepository`,
where both objects would be exposed in a different provider.

Such scenario is possible by using the `ref` object that providers receives as
parameter:

```dart
final userRepositoryProvider = Provider((ref) => UserRepository());

final userControllerProvider = StateNotifierProvider((ref) {
  return UserController(
    // Read userRepositoryProvider and create a UserController from the result
    repository: ref.watch(userRepositoryProvider),
  );
});
```

more informations such as:

- What happens if I create an object from a value which can change over time?
- Some good practices tips

## Reading a provider outside of providers using Dart only

In some scenarios, you may want to read a provider in a package that has no
dependency on Flutter.  
A common use-case is to test a class unrelated to widgets.

In this situation, you can use [ProviderContainer], which is a low-level
utility to manipulate providers.

The following snippet demonstrates how a test can read providers without using Flutter:

```dart
test('counter starts at 0', () {
  final container = ProviderContainer();

  StateController<int> counter = container.read(counterProvider);
  expect(counter.state, 0);
});
```

:::danger
Do not reuse the instance of [ProviderContainer] between tests.  
This ensures that the state of your providers properly resets between test cases.
